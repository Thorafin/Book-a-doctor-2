	<h2>Best Medical & Health care Needs to Our Patients</h2>
	<div class="about-box">

			<p>
				Group has always strived to meet various needs of people by contributing to the business sectors of education, hospitality, realty, power, and most recently healthcare. Healthcare being a basic human need, we felt that our integrated township of Kohinoor City would be incomplete without a good healthcare facility like Kohinoor Hospital, a well-equipped multispecialty green building hospital.

Green is the way to go for the future if we have to preserve valuable resources available to us. Right from the construction stage, we took great care to see that we adhered to all the stringent requirements for a green building. I am proud to say that our efforts bore fruit when Kohinoor Hospital was awarded LEED Platinum Certification, the highest, and became the first hospital in Asia and second in the world to receive Platinum rating.

Going green results in substantial savings on power costs, water and other resources. Besides, the atmosphere in the hospital is always kept clean and fresh with the help of special carbon dioxide sensors which automatically inject oxygen into the atmosphere if carbon dioxide exceeds a certain level. This helps patients recover faster and also prevents the relatives of patients from feeling fatigued. As the hospital staff is constantly exposed to fresh air, it improves their productivity enabling them to serve the patients better.

<br/>Kohinoor always strives to give its patrons the best and this goes for Kohinoor Hospital too.
